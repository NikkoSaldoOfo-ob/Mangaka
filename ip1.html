                    </h2>
                    <p>Before anything is done the theme or story is chosen. An idea is needed - What is the genre? What is the manga all about? Who are the target readers? All these things should be done firsthand. Choosing the theme is one of the crucial part of creating manga because it is where the author decides the path that manga will take.</p>

                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <p>Writting the plot. This is where the general theme of the manga is used. The author decides on the story and everything befpre drawing anything on <a href="#in" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#paper">paper</a>. Events are written and sometimes even character dialogs are also written at this process. Mostly mangakas also write a number at the left side of the plot and mark the page where this part is drawn. When they already have a firm theme and plot, authors are going to move to the artistic side of the process.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>At this process mangakas make some examples of their characters. Not only what they looks like - characteristics of the character also. Name, age, size, maybe favourite colour - are decided. Settings are also decided. Depending on the theme of the manga, mangakas choose and draw an example of their settings. What kind of setting do they have? In what time period does the story take place?</p>
                    <p> Mostly proffessional mangakas have <a href="#in" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#ass">assistants</a>, and most of the time the assistants are the one drawing the background which is where the setting and background designs are used. At this point everything is important information.</p>

                    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
                    <p>Drawing storyboards. After stablishing the plot, authors can now start with the pages. What will they look like? At the beginning they just draw a rough <a href="#in" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#pencil">pencil</a> sketch on a paper to get a idea of how it will look. These rough sketches are called storyboards which are also called "name". Its main goal is to let the author decide where to place the character and backgrounds or in other words it helps the author visualize what the page will look like. Speech bubbles, and panels also are added to the sketch. After doing the storyboards, what comes next is the inking process.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>At this part the sketch gets "redrawn" but with a clean line and with - mostly black - ink. The artist is drawing over the pencil line and at the end he erease the sketch. Also a little bit of shading is done. Inking the comic is almost essential. The only exception would be if the artist chose to use a dark permanent lead pencil. Inking is basically tracing. The goal of inking is to get smooth, dark, “printer friendly” lines. The pencil drawing underneath is erased and only the ink will remain. If inking is sloppy, then the next step takes a lot longer to finish. The so called <a href="#in" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#gpen">G-Pen</a> is one of the most used sign spring for mangakas.</p>

                    <h2>Computer Editing
                    </h2>
                    <p>After the page is inked it gets scanned and edited on a pc. The artist cleans it up with a Photo-editing program. Most of the time <a href="#in" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#gt">graphics tablets</a> are used in this process. <a href="#in" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#wac">Wacom</a> is a good brand for such tablets. When the page is clean, patterns are added. These patterns are added for shadows and explosions. The pattern could be crossed lines or dots or whatever. The software that is used depends on what the mangaka like. There are many different ones. Photoshop is one of the most used. Keep in mind that today some mangas are only drawn on computers without the inking stage. But the pencil sketching is mostly still done. Before any effects are ever added, the artist touches up the artwork to get it as clean as possible. Effects can also be added by using screen tones. <a href="#in" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#stone">Screen tones</a> can be purchased as a physical product or can be added digitally. (If purchased as an actual product, adding them would occur in a step in between inking and computer editing).</p>

                                <p>The g-pen is a pen nib which is originally used for writing letters in the old days. G-pens are the most famous type of pen nib used by professional mangakas. These pen nibs can produce both thick and thin lines depending on the amount of pressure applied from our hand towards the paper. Among all the other pen nibs in manga g-pens can produce the thickest line. G-pens are mostly used for shonen manga genres (such as action, sports, etc) since most shonen manga uses thick lines to deliver strong impressions to the readers. If you are a beginner it isn't suggested to use the g-pen since if you can't control the amount of pressure added towards the pen you might make a very thick line that would ruin your drawing or even a line that is too thin for your drawing.</p>

                                <p>There are many kinds of drawing pencils; here’s an overview of lead hardness, line darkness, and varieties of pencils for drawing. A good pencil is an artist’s best friend. No subject is beyond an artist’s rendering if they have the pencils they need. A good rule of thumb to remember what each pencil does is to remember that the softer the lead, the darker your line will be. Pencils with “B” in the name are soft. Pencils with “H” in the name are harder leads.</p>

                                <h1>Types</h1>
                                </center>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Clutch or Lead Holder pencils</strong> – They use 2mm graphite refills which are the same size as the wood cased pencils. There is a clutch mechanism in the tip that is activated by the plunger which holds the refill firmly in place. This allows artists to extend the graphite as far as they may desire as well as retract it for more detail work.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Wooden pencils</strong> – The most common is F, the wood cased pencil. These generally come in sets of 9B to 9H and are what most new artists begin using.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Mechanical pencils.</strong> –  Standard mechanical pencils can be found in several thicknesses. .3mm, .5mm and .7mm with .3 being a bit tricky to find. Many artists use these exclusively and are able to produce stunning work with them.</li>

                                    <li><strong>2H</strong> – This is a very hard lead pencil that makes light marks. It is good for drawing details and preliminary drawings that you may not want to be permanent.</li>
                                    <li><strong>6B</strong> – This pencil makes dark, softer marks. The 6B shown in the example is a wide woodless, which is great for expressive drawing and sketching.</li>
                                    <li><strong>#2 or HB</strong> – You remember this pencil from school. Most of use started our drawing career using this beauty to doodle on homework. Its lead falls between soft and hard and makes a great all-around go-to pencil. Keep this one with your sketchbook at all times.</li>
                                    <li><strong>#2 Jumbo</strong> – Remember these monster-sized pencils from kindergarten? They have all of the benefits of a regular #2, but they have a very wide lead that is perfect for expressive drawings and thick lines.</li>
                                     <li><strong>2B</strong> – Softer than the HB, 2B makes darker lines. 2B is great for outlining drawings.</li>

                                <p>Screentone is a technique for applying textures and shades to drawings, used as an alternative to hatching. In the conventional process, patterns are transferred to paper from preprinted sheets, but the technique is also simulated in computer graphics. Traditional screen tones are apllied by sticking it on the paper and then using a cutting board and a cutter, the tones a cut to match its desired position.</p>

                                <p>A graphics tablet (also known as a digitizer, drawing tablet, digital drawing tablet, pen tablet, or digital art board) is a computer input device that enables a user to hand-draw images, animations and graphics, with a special pen-like stylus, similar to the way a person draws images with a pencil and paper. These tablets may also be used to capture data or handwritten signatures. It can also be used to trace an image from a piece of paper which is taped or otherwise secured to the tablet surface. Capturing data in this way, by tracing or entering the corners of linear poly-lines or shapes, is called digitizing. Today some mangas are only drawn on computers using a tablet. So this piece of technology is a powerful tool that enables artists to do amazing things.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Filling up the artwork details (such as screentones, hair, clothing, special effects) after the mangaka has drawn the basics.</li>
                                    <li>Drawing the time-consuming elements, such as scene backgrounds and crowds, allowing the mangaka to focus more on the plot and character development.</li>
                                    <li>Drawing specific things. For example, Go Nagai mangaka employed an assistant to draw helicopters and military vehicles.</li>
                                    <li>Cleaning up any artwork that goes out of the panels. Mikio Ikemoto helps Masashi Kishimoto with this, among other things, in producing Naruto.</li>
                                    <li>Being the mangaka's sounding board for ideas, but the assistants almost never help with the plot itself.</li>
