                    </h2>
                    <p>A manga editor is usually an employee of a publishing company. Usually, manga is what appears in a manga magazine(like Weekly Jump). So the editor contacts the mangaka assigned to them, tells them what manga they want, how many pages are required, etc.</p>
                <p>And usually, a mangaka talks to his editor for points regarding the plot (and even their storylines!), and decides what manga he draws and how he draws it. Then he draws a 'name'(rough sketch of manga) and let the editor check it. If everything is ok, mangaka begins to draw real manga. And sometimes the editor make various errands like to research for his mangaka.</p>
                <p>Also, editors teach a new-comer how to draw manga (though most of them cannot draw manga).</p>

                    <h2>Manga Demographics
                        <br>
                    </h2>
                        <p>Before making a manga, the mangaka must first decide on what genre or demographic of manga he is going to make. It can be either Shoujo, Shounen, or Seinen manga.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shounen</strong> manga is generally  manga  targeted towards the "young boy" market. The usual topics for this involve fighting, friendship and sometimes super powers. Some manga that fall into this category include "Bleach", "Naruto", and "OnePiece."</p>
                        <p><strong>Shoujo</strong> manga is manga  targeted towards the "young girl" market. Usually the story is from the point of view of a girl and deals with romance, drama or magic. The art style of Shoujo manga largely differs from Shounen manga especially in the depiction of characters. Shounen manga characters are depicted with masculinity while Shoujo manga characters are drawn with very feminine characteristics. This makes even the male characters in Shoujo manga look like female characters.</p>
                        <p><strong>Seinen</strong> manga are manga marketed to adolescent boys and men old enough to read kanji. In Japanese, the word 'seinen' literally means "youth", but the term "seinen manga" is also used to describe the audience of comics like Weekly Manga Times and Weekly Manga Goraku which are aimed at men on into their 50s. Seinen manga usually contain gory scenes, nudity, violence, and such. Although most shounen manga also contain violence, Seinen manga tend to be highly graphic and more . Seinen manga also have very deep story lines.</p>

                    <h2>Submitting Manga
                        <br>
                    </h2>
                    <p>The first contact a mangaka makes with the editorial department is when they submit their manga! </p>
                    <p>Mangakas who want their work to be published in magazine such as Shounen Jump! first need to make a 'name' which is a one-shot (a manga piece that is completed in only a few pages). The one-shot is then scanned by an editor from the publishing company. The editor evaluates the quality of the work, the art style, the story line, and the over all readability.</p>
                    <p>Once a manga has been approved by an editor, it is once again sent to be screened by other editors in a competition with other submissions. There are a lot after all! Once a manga was chosen, it will be published for all the readers to enjoy. Additionally, a mangaka who has made an exceptional manga can be called by the publishing company to be one of their official mangaka! An editor is then assigned to them, and the mangaka starts his path towards being the best authors of Japan! If all goes well, his manga can even be turned into anime!</p>
                    <p>Once a mangaka gets serialized, he needs to start working properly. As of this moment, drawing manga is no longer just a hobby or pastime but rather a job. He gets to sign a contract with the publishing company, and then given salary based of course on how well his manga sells. In the beginning, the editor suggests assistants to work with the mangaka. Assistants are extremely crucial in making manga, especially on a week-based publication. Shounen manga artists are particularly in need of assistants.</p>
